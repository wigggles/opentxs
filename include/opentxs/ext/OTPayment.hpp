/*
  The PAYMENT can be of types:
    - CHEQUE, INVOICE, VOUCHER (these are all forms of cheque)
    - PAYMENT PLAN, SMART CONTRACT (these are cron items)

 FYI:

 Contract — Most other classes are derived from this one. Contains the actual
 XML contents,
  as well as various data values that were loaded from those contents, including
 public keys.
  Also contains a list of signatures.

 OTScriptable — Derived from Contract, but enables scriptable clauses. Also
 contains a list
  of parties (each with agents and asset accounts) as well as a list of bylaws
 (each with scripted
  clauses, internal state, hooks, callbacks, etc.)

 OTInstrument — Has a date range, a server ID, and an instrument definition id.
 Derived from
 OTScriptable.

 OTTrackable  — Has a transaction number, user ID, and an asset account ID.
 Derived from OTInstrument.

 OTCheque — A financial instrument. Derived from OTTrackable.

 OTCronItem — Derived from OTTrackable. OT has a central “Cron” object which
 runs recurring tasks, known as CronItems.

 OTAgreement — Derived from OTCronItem. It has a recipient and recipient asset
 account.

 OTPaymentPlan — Derived from OTAgreement, derived from OTCronItem. Allows
 merchants and customers
  to set up recurring payments. (Cancel anytime, with a receipt going to both
 inboxes.)

 OTSmartContract — Derived from OTCronItem. All CronItems are actually derived
 from OTScriptable already
  (through OTTrackable/OTInstrument). But OTSmartContract is the first/only Cron
 Item specifically designed
  to take full advantage of both the cron system AND the scriptable system in
 conjunction with each other.
  Currently OTSmartContract is the only actual server-side scripting on OT.

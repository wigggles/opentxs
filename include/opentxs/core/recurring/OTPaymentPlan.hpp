 OTPaymentPlan

 This instrument is signed by two parties or more (the first one, I think...)

 While processing payment, BOTH parties to a payment plan will be loaded up and
 their signatures will be checked against the original plan, which is saved as a
 cron receipt.

 There is also a "current version" of the payment plan, which contains updated
 info
 from processing, and is signed by the server.

 BOTH the original version, and the updated version, are sent to EACH user
 whenever
 a payment is processed, as his receipt. This way you have the user's signature
 on
 the terms, and the server's signature whenever it carries out the terms. A
 receipt
 with both is placed in the inbox of both users after any action.

 As with cheques, the server can use the receipts in the inboxes, plus the last
 agreed
 balance, to prove the current balance of any account. The user removes the
 receipt from
 his inbox by accepting it and, in the process, performing a new balance
 agreement.

 THIS MEANS that the OT server can carry out the terms of contracts!  So far, at
 least,
 cheques, trades, payment plans... as long as everything is signed off, we're
 free and
 clear under the same triple-signed system that account transfer uses. (The
 Users cannot
 repudiate their own signatures later, and the server can prove all balances
 with the
 user's own signature.)

 Of course, either side is free to CANCEL a payment plan, or to leave their
 account bereft
 of funds and prone to failed payments. But if they cancel, their signature will
 appear
 on the cancellation request, and the recipient gets a copy of it in his inbox.
 And if
 the funds are insufficient, the plan will keep trying to charge, leaving
 failure notices
 in both inboxes when such things occur.

 You could even have the server manage an issuer account, backed in payment plan
 revenue,
 that would form a new instrument definition that can then be traded on markets.
 (The same
 as you can
 have the server manage the issuer account for a basket currency now, which is
 backed with
 reserve accounts managed by the server, and you can then trade the basket
 currency on markets.)

    // copy can be loaded, and BOTH Nyms can be checked to verify that BOTH

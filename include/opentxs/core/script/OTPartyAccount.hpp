// Each party has a list of accounts. Just as the agent, depending on context,
// MAY
// have an unowned-but-useful pointer to its active Nym, similarly a
// partyaccount
// MAY have an unowned-but-useful point to its actual Account.
//
// (Normally, an OTPartyAccount is loaded with the party, as part of an
// OTScriptable-
// derived object, and it doesn't actually load a copy of the actual Nyms and
// Accounts
// at that time, it just stores their IDs. But times may also come when the
// actual pointer
// is passed in for use by the Parties, who are not otherwise expected to do
// anything
// with it, or to clean it up or rely on it for their normal data storage.)
//
// Represents an account (to a party.) This is because ACTUALLY loading the REAL
// account is a pain in the ass,
// and we just want to store its ID, etc.  This way, the party can OWN this
// information about this list of
// accounts, and store it, load it, destroy it, etc, often without involving the
// actual account file at all.
//
// (Even if a this isn't currently doing anything with any of the party's
// accounts, the contract still
// has to have a LIST of them, so it knows what to do in those cases when it
// DOES need to do something.)
//
// For example, this is where we store the CLOSING TRANSACTION # for that
// account (for this agreement.)
// That number can't be found in the account itself, but all smart contracts
// involving asset accounts must
// provide a closing number for each asset account.

    // changing balances) but I do NOT have to require one for processing the

                // get new transaction numbers WITHOUT HAVING TO BURN ONE TO DO
                // IT.  You
                // still have to do a transaction statement to do it (sign off
                // on the
                // ones that you actually do have), but you can still process
                // the Nymbox
                // even if you have zero transaction numbers, whereas with the
                // inbox for
                // an asset account, you cannot process it until you burn a
                // transaction
                // number to do so. And if you don't have any transaction
                // numbers to do

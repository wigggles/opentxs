                                        // 2. Bob loops through the payments
                                        // INBOX, and for each, he grabs an
                                        // OTNumList containing all the
                                        // transaction numbers. One of those
                                        // (the matching one) will contain
                                        // "X,0". (Except it will actually only
                                        // contain "X", since 0 is ignored in

                // to process the Nymbox, and you use the Nymbox to get
                // transaction numbers, then how can you ever get a new
                // number if you run out?  You need a number to get a number?
                // //
                // That makes no logical sense.  Therefore, the Nymbox
                // provides a way to get new transaction numbers WITHOUT
                // HAVING TO BURN ONE TO DO IT.  You still have to do a
                // transaction statement to do it (sign off on the ones that
                // you actually do have), but you can still process the
                // Nymbox even if you have zero transaction numbers, whereas
                // with the inbox for an asset account, you cannot process
                // it until you burn a transaction number to do so. And if
                // you don't have any transaction numbers to do that with,
                // that's fine: you just get a new one via your nymbox.

                // first place.

                // cannot actually REMOVE your transaction numbers, but it

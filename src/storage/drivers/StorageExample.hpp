/** \brief An example implementation of \ref Storage which demonstrates how
 *  to implement support for new storage backends.
 *
 *  \ingroup storage
 *
 *  \par Basic Concepts
 *  \ref Storage requires that implementations capable of key-value storage
 *  and retrieval.
 *
 *  \par
 *  Keys must be capable of being stored to, and retrieved from, one of two
 *  specified buckets: primary or secondary.
 *
 *  \par
 *  The parent class guarentees that all key-value pairs accessed via the \ref
 *Load
 *  and \ref Store methods satisfy the following conditions:
 *
 *  \par
 *    * Values are immutable
 *    * Keys are unique
 *
 *  \par
 *  Those guarentees typically mean that an implementation only requires a small
 *  subset of the backend's feature set. In particular, the assumptions are
 *  valid:
 *
 *  \par
 *   * The ability to alter a value after it has been stored is NOT required
 *   * The ability to delete an individual value is NOT required
 *   * \ref Store and \ref Load calls are idempotent.
 *
 *  \par
 *  \note The parent class will rely on the idempotence of \ref Store and \ref
 *Load
 *  methods. Ensure these methods are thread safe.
 *
 *  \par Root Hash
 *  The root hash is the only exception to the general rule of immutable values.
 *  See the description of the \ref LoadRoot and \ref StoreRoot methods for
 *details.
 *: ot_super(config, hash random)
 *  \par Configuration
 *  Define all needed runtime configuration parameters in the
 *  \ref StorageConfig class.
 *
 *  \par
 *  Instantate these parameters in the \ref OT::Init_Storage method,
 *  using the existing sections as a template.

     *
     *    * The filesystem driver uses directories to implement buckets.
     *      Emptying a bucket consists of renaming the directory to a random
     *      name, spawing a detached thread to delete it in the background,
     *      and creating a new empty directory with the correct name.
     *    * SQL-based backends can use tables to implement buckets. Emptying a
     *      bucket can be implemented with a DROP TABLE command followed by a
     *      CREATE TABLE command.

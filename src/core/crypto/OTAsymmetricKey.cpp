    // rectify that. See below NOTE for
    // more details.
    //
    // NOTE: It's very unusual that the above is commented out, since my normal
    // convention is to
    // call this function both in the destructor, as well as in the Release()
    // method for any given
    // class.
    // Here's why it's commented out, in this case. Because all it does is call
    // ReleaseKeyLowLevel,
    // which calls ReleaseKeyLowLevel_Hook, which is pure virtual and is what
    // allows the
    // OTAsymmetricKey_OpenSSL class to clean up its OpenSSL-specific private
    // members.
    // We CANNOT call a pure virtual method from a destructor (which is where we
    // currently are)
    // and so we cannot call Release_AsymmetricKey without removing that pure
    // virtual call. The
    // problem is, ReleaseKeyLowLevel USES that pure virtual call all over this
    // file (i.e. in many
    // other places BESIDES the destructor) and so we cannot just remove the
    // pure virtual call it
    // uses which is, in fact, the entire purpose it's being called in the first
    // place. So what I
    // did was, I changed OTAsymmetricKey_OpenSSL to directly clean up its
    // OpenSSL-specific key data,
    // and it just ALSO has the hook override doing the same thing. This way
    // Release_AsymmetricKey
    // can continue to be used by ReleaseKeyLowLevel all over this file, as it
    // was designed, using
    // the hook and the override, yet also this destructor will continue to work
    // perfectly... because
    // Release_AsymmetricKey() is commented out above, we won't have any runtime
    // errors from trying to
    // run a pure virtual method from a destructor. And because
    // OTAsymmetricKey_OpenSSL now cleans itself
    // up in its own destructor automatically, we have no need whatsoever to
    // call a virtual function here
    // to clean it up. So it's commented out.
    // Makes sense? Of course we didn't have any virtuality before
    // OTAsymmetricKey_OpenSSL was added,
    // since OTAsymmetricKey previously had no subclasses at all. But that has
    // changed recently, so that
    // it is now an abstract interface, so that someday a GPG implementation, or

    How does this work?

    When trying to open a normal nym, the password callback realizes we are
    calling it in "NOT master mode", so instead of just collecting the
    passphrase and giving it back to OpenSSL, it calls this function first,
    which returns the master password (so that IT can be given to OpenSSL
    instead.)

    If the master wasn't already loaded (common) then we call the callback in
    here ourselves. Notice it's recursive! But this time, the callback sees we
    ARE in master mode, so it doesn't call this function again (which would be
    an infinite loop.) Instead, it collects the password as normal, only instead
    of passing it back to the caller via the buffer, it uses the passUserInput
    by attaching it to thePWData before the call. That way the callback function
    can set passUserInput with whatever it retrieved from the user, and then
    back in this function again we can get the passUserInput and use it to
    unlock the MASTER passphrase, which we set onto theOutput.

    When this function returns true, the callback (0th level of recursion) uses
    theOutput as the "passphrase" for all Nyms, passing it to OpenSSL.

    This way, OpenSSL gets a random key instead of a passphrase, and the
    passphrase is just used for encrypting that random key whenever its timer
    has run out.

    4. (SOON) will use VirtualProtect on Windows (standard API for protected
    memory)
    5. (SOON) and similarly have option in config file for ssh-agent, gpg-agent,
    etc.
    6. Even without those things,the master password is stored in an encrypted
    form after it times out.
    7. While decrypted (while timer is going) it's still got the above security
    mechanisms,
    plus options for standard protected-memory APIs are made available wherever
    possible.
    8. The actual passphrase the user types is not stored in memory, except just
    std::int64_t enough to
    use it to derive another key, used to unlock the actual key (for a temporary
    period of time.)
    9. Meanwhile the actual key is stored in encrypted form on disk, and the
    derived key isn't stored anywhere.
    10. Ultimately external hardware, and smart cards, are the way to go. But OT
    should still do the best possible.

/*

 Normally when I read someone ELSE'S public key, I DON'T have their Nymfile.
 Therefore I don't HAVE any of their credentials, I only have the NymID and the
 public key itself. Which was fine before, since you hashed the public key to
 verify the NymID -- and if it matched, then all was good.

 But let's say I'm reading a public key from a key credential... the hash of
 that key
 (or credential) is NOT necessarily the hash of the Nym's ID. So how can I
 verify it?

 Normally I read from:  ~/.ot/client_data/pubkeys/NYM_ID   (for the public key
 for that Nym.)

 Instead I want to read up all available credentials for that Nym.
 Let's say their IDs are stored in: ~/.ot/client_data/pubkeys/NYM_ID.cred
 And the credentials themselves:
 ~/.ot/client_data/pubkeys/credentials/NYM_ID/CREDENTIAL_ID

 So let's say I have a NymID and I need to load his credentials and use his keys
 to verify
 the Nym and also to send him messages, verify his signatures on instruments,
 etc.

 pNym->LoadPublicKey() should load the UNSIGNED Nymfile from:
 ~/.ot/client_data/pubkeys/NYM_ID.cred
 Which, in the course of loading, should automatically load all its credentials
 from
 ~/.ot/client_data/pubkeys/credentials/NYM_ID/CREDENTIAL_ID

 From there, we call VerifyPseudonym, which verifies all the credentials
 internally, including
 their signatures, and which verifies them against their source, which can also
 be hashed to
 reproduce the NymID.

 ...SINCE all the credentials verify AGAINST THEIR SOURCE, and the source hashes
 to form the NymID,
 then the Nym is therefore self-verifying, without having to sign the nymfile
 itself (for public nyms.)
 If I want to sign it anyway, well I will need a private Nym to sign it with, I
 cannot sign it with
 only a public Nym. So I will have to pass the signer in if I want to do that.
 But it's unnecessary,
 and in fact it's also unnecessary for private Nyms, (or is it?) because all the
 credentials ARE signed
 contracts already, and since they all ultimately verify to their source.

 Therefore this eliminates LoadSignedNymfile? And SaveSignedNymFile? Or augments
 -- since we will be backwards compatible...

 I'll load the local Nym's credential list and the public nym's credential list
 from the same
 place: ~/.ot/client_data/credentials/NYM_ID.cred
 EITHER WAY I'll load the actual credentials, each from
 ~/.ot/client_data/credentials/NYM_ID/CRED_ID
 Then for the local Nym, I'll load his Nymfile like normal from
 ~/.ot/client_data/nyms/NYM_ID
 (For public Nyms, I don't need to load a Nymfile or anything else -- the
 credentials are all there is.)

 But I still want my Nymfile itself signed, so people can't mess with my
 transaction numbers.
 What it comes down to is, I must put the credential list in a separate file,
 load it, verify it,
 and then use it to verify the signature on the Nymfile which contains
 everything else. So the
 "LoadSignedNymfile" process isn't going to change for the Nymfile itself, and I
 will have the credential
 list in a separate file, just like the certs were in a separate file in the
 original system (for the
 same reasons.)

/*
 How will VerifyPseudonym change now that we are adding credentials?

 Before it was easy: hash the public key, and compare the result to the NymID
 as it was already set by the wallet. If they match, then this really is the
 public
 key that I was expecting. (You could not change out that key without causing
 the ID
 to also change.)

 How are things with credentials?

 The public key may not directly hash to the Nym ID, but even if it did, which
 public key?
 Aren't there THREE public keys for each credential? That is, a signing,
 authentication, and
 encryption key. Which one is used as that Key ID? Perhaps all three are hashed
 together?
 And that collective three-key is only valid for a given Nym, if its credential
 contract is
 signed by a master key for that Nym. And that master key is only valid if its
 authority
 verifies properly. And the Nym's ID should be a hash somehow, of that
 authority. All of those
 things must verify in VerifyPseudonym, in the new system.

 Is that really true?

 Pseudo-code:

 Loop through the credentials for this Nym.
 For each, the authority/source string (which resolve to the NymID) should be
 identical.
 Resolve the NymID and compare it to the one that was expected.
 An extended version will also verify the authority itself, to see if it
 verifies the key.
 For example if this Nym is issued based on a Namecoin address, then the code
 would actually
 check Namecoin itself to verify the NymID is the same one posted there.

 Enumeration for all xml nodes which are parsed by IrrXMLReader.

 Enumeration values:

 EXN_NONE            No xml node. This is usually the node if you did not read
 anything yet.
 EXN_ELEMENT        A xml element, like <foo>.
 EXN_ELEMENT_END    End of an xml element, like </foo>.
 EXN_TEXT            Text within a xml element: <foo> this is the text. </foo>.
 EXN_COMMENT        An xml comment like <!-- I am a comment --> or a DTD
 definition.
 EXN_CDATA            An xml cdata section like <![CDATA[ this is some CDATA
 ]]>.
 EXN_UNKNOWN        Unknown element.
